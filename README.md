## Linting

Bobocraft uses [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) for checking and linting Rust code. If you use VS Code or a derivative thereof, this should be enabled already (see `.vscode` in this repository) If not, check if your IDE supports changing the rust analyzer check command or simply run `cargo clippy` from a shell. If you installed Rust via `rustup` with its default configuration, Clippy should already be installed. If not, you can run `rustup component add clippy` from your shell to install it.
